## Cloud Concepts
- [ ] **Major advantages of cloud computing**:
  * High availability: Systems are designed to operate continuously without failure for a long time. These systems avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures.
  * Elasticity: You can provision only what you need, and then grow and shrink based on demand.
  * Agility: All the services you have access to help you innovate faster, giving you speed to market. 
  * Durability: Your data will remain intact without corruption.

- [ ] **Cloud computing models**:
  * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Building blocks (Eg. Web hosting, EC2)
  * Software as a Service (Saas): Complete application (Eg. Email)
  * Platform as a Service (PaaS): Used by developers (Eg. Storefront website)

- [ ] **Deployment models**:
  * Private Cloud (on-premises): Exists in internal data center and don't offer advantages of cloud computing
  * Public Cloud (AWS): Provides all advantages of cloud computing and users are not responsible for physical hardware
  * Hybrid Cloud: Highly sensitive data stored locally and application runs on AWS infrastructure. Communication between private and public cloud is through **AWS Direct Connect**
